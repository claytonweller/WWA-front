## Why?

We all have big artistic dreams, but we can't do everything ourselves. Work With Artists lets you easily search and contact artists who do exactly what you need.

_OR_

You are an artists. You love making art. You want to do more projects, and work with new people, but it's exhausting putting yourself out there. Work With Artists makes finding projects way easier:

## How?

An artist creates an account, which takes basic demographic information, a list of artistic disciplines, some display information, and a longer bio. Once they have their info entered they're searchable in the database.

Once a user/artist is logged in they reach the search page which allows any registered user to serach the database by artistic discipline and then filter by experience (in years) and desired compensation (reward). Once the search results are shown, the searcher can then browse the artists until they find someone they're excited to work with. They can then contact them through the app. The app uses sendgrid to send an email to the artist which they can choose to respond to or not.

At any time artists can change their info, and add/remove disciplines to their profile. Also, if a particular artistic discipline isn't in the database yet they can easily add it, in the profile.
